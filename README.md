# EDAF05-labs
Laborations for EDAF05, held at LTH during study period 4 2018-19. Lecturer and course convenor is Jonas Skeppstedt. This version of the lab assignments are written and maintained by Lars Åström. If you find any errors, ambiguitys or anything else that should be corrected - please contact me via e-mail: astrom.lars@telia.com   

## How to do labs:
1. Clone repository.
2. Write solution in preferred languange. The supported languages in the course are Python and Java. Some lab instructors may help with C and C++, but it is not guaranteed. Put the solution in the folder of the lab.
3. Navigate (in terminal) to the directory of the current lab. 
4. 
    - Write the following command: 
        - bash check_solution.sh 
    - followed by the code to run your program. For example:
        - bash check_solution.sh python3 solution.py
        - bash check_solution.sh java solution
        - bash check_solution.sh ./a.out
    - where solution.py / solution is the solution file. ./a.out is the compiled file of a C or C++ solution.
5. If the solution was correct, this will be written in the terminal. Otherwise you will see which instance your solution failed on.
6. When your solution is correct, show this to your lab instructor who will pass you on the lab.
7. After showing the output of the bash-script you and your lab instructor will look at your code and discuss it thoroughly, as well as your report and the answer to the questions in the lab instructions.
8. Note that it is considered cheating to manipulate the bash-scripts in order to trick the instructor into passing you.
