# Briefly comment the results
# Did the script say all your solutions were correct?
yes

# Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input?
4huge: 
real    0m3.056s
user    0m2.594s
sys     0m0.438s 

only graph input:
real    0m1.049s
user    0m0.609s
sys     0m0.422s

only sorting no kruskal:
real    0m2.999s

# What takes the majority of the time?
sorting the tree

# How did you implement the solution?
krushal
# Which data structures were used? 
# Which modifications to these data structures were used? 
# What is the overall running time? Why?


## Instruction questions

# Why does the algorithm you have implemented produce a minimal spanning tree?
since it connects every node with the arch having the lowest weight first

# What is the time complexity, and more importantly why?
O(m log m) because that is the time complexity of the heap sort used

# What happens if one of the edges you have chosen to include collapses? Might there be any problems with that in real applications?


# Can you think of any real applications of MST? What would the requirements of a problem need to be in orderfor us to want MST as a solution?
